# Gradient Descent: A Key Optimization Technique in Machine Learning

## Overview
Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization technique widely used in machine learning for training models.

## Significance
It plays a crucial role in minimizing the error (loss or cost) and finding the optimal parameters of a model.

## Parameters
- **Number of Iterations:** Determining the appropriate number of iterations is essential; too few may lead to underfitting, while too many may result in overfitting.
- **Learning Rate:** The learning rate controls the step size during parameter updates. Selecting an optimal learning rate is crucial for convergence; smaller values ensure stability but may increase training time.
- **Initial Guess:** The initial guess or starting point influences the convergence of gradient descent. It's essential to initialize parameters sensibly to facilitate convergence.

## Mathematical Insight
The gradient (derivative) of the loss function points in the direction of the greatest increase. Gradient descent utilizes this property to iteratively update parameters towards minimizing the loss.

## Update Rule
The update formula involves subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient from the current parameter values. This process guides parameter updates towards minimizing the loss function.
**_For example_:** _guess = guess - learning_rate * gradient_

## Iteration Process
Gradient descent repeats the parameter update process for a specified number of iterations. Each iteration moves the parameters closer to the optimal values, ultimately minimizing the loss function.
